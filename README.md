This is a small demo of a game I made with three other students during the course "Design and Construction of Digital Games" given at Gothenburg University/Chalmers, we had two weeks of planning, four weeks of programming and two more weeks of reflection and analysis. We made a small demo of a rogue-like game that we later called "One-Trick Gnomes".
